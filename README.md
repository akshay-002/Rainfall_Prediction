## Introduction

Rainfall prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of weather patterns. This project aims to develop machine learning models capable of accurately predicting rainfall based on meteorological factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Accurate rainfall forecasts can help stakeholders make informed decisions and mitigate the impact of extreme weather events.

## Data Preparation

The dataset used in this project consists of historical weather data collected from Australian weather station. Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features were applied to prepare the dataset for model training.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the relationships between different meteorological variables and rainfall. Visualizations such as histograms, and correlation matrices were used to explore the dataset and identify patterns.

## Model Training

Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, and neural networks, were trained on the preprocessed data. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques were employed to optimize the performance of each model.

## Model Evaluation

The trained models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Performance comparison and analysis were conducted to identify the best-performing model for rainfall prediction.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in rainfall prediction. By leveraging historical weather data and advanced modeling techniques, accurate rainfall forecasts can be generated, aiding various industries and sectors in decision-making and risk management.
